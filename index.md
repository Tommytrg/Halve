# About me

I'm a Software Engineer student. I'm a programming enthusiast, specifically web technologies and I'm constantly learning.

Currently, I'm a full stack developer working with Node.js and vanilla javascript in the UX department at 'El Corte Ingles'.

In my free time I'm expanding my knowledge of functional programming and Algorithm.

But not everything is about programming! I enjoy learning foreign languages, reading books and playing videogames :)
