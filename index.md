# About me

I'm a Software Developer. I'm a programming enthusiast, specifically web technologies and I'm constantly learning.

Currently, I'm a software developer working with Rust and Javascript in the development of the witnet protocol.

In my free time I'm expanding my knowledge of crypto ecosystem, functional programming and Algorithm.

But not everything is about programming! I enjoy learning foreign languages, reading books and playing videogames :)
